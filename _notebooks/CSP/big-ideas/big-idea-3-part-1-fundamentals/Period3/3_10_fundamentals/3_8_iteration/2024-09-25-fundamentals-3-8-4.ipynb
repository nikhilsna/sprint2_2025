    "\n",
    "- **Multiple Conditions**: Nested if statements allow you to add layers of condition checks, which is helpful when you want to ensure that several criteria are met before executing certain code.\n",
    "- **Code Readability**: While nested if statements provide flexibility, too many levels of nesting can make the code harder to read. Always try to keep nesting simple and clear.\n",
    "- **Real-World Use**: Nested if statements are commonly used in scenarios where decisions need to be made based on multiple criteria, such as filtering or categorizing data."
